# killahtask
A simple TODO CLI tool for managing your tasks. The Cobra package was used to create the CLI interface. Tasks are written to a CSV file in the following header structure `task_id, description, created, completed`. The CSV file that `killahtask` reads/writes is locked to prevent concurrent access. The file gets created in your home directory: `~/killahtask_<username>.csv`

This CLI tool performs simple CRUD operations:
```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask add "my really cool task"
dill@dilly:~$ killahtask list
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask complete <task_id>
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask delete <task_id>
```

After cloning the repo, you can build the tool directly into /usr/local/bin (or run it locally from the project directory):
```bash
dilly@dilly:~/projects/killahtask$ sudo go build -o /usr/local/bin/killahtask
```
Then run:
```
killahtask
```
Output:
```

## Add
Add a task (aliases `add` or `a`):

```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask add "my really cool task"
Task "my really cool task" added successfully!
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask a "some other really cool task"
Task "some other really cool task" added successfully!
```

Descriptions must be wrapped in double quotes:

```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask a task without double quotes
Too many arguments passed to the "add" command
Usage: killahtask add "my description"
```

Task descriptions must be unique.

```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask a "some other really cool task"
Task description isn't unique! "some other really cool task" already exists.
```

## List
By default, list shows incomplete tasks. Use `--all (-a)` to show all tasks.

**Default output:**
```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask list
ID     Description                    Created
0      my thing                       2 hours ago
2      Something else really cool     2 hours ago
3      My other thing                 an hour ago
```

**With `--all` output:**
```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask list --all
ID     Description                    Created         Completed
0      my thing                       2 hours ago     false
2      Something else really cool     2 hours ago     false
3      My other thing                 2 hours ago     false
4      My other thing 2               an hour ago     true
```

## Complete
Mark a task complete:
```
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask complete
Task ID is missing!
Usage: killahtask complete <task_id>
dilly@dilly:~$ killahtask complete 123 123

``` 

## Tab Completion
Cobra can generate completion scripts for several shells.
To enable completion:
1. Generate a completion script for your shell:
2. Source the file (or move it to your shell's completion directory).
3. Restart your shell.

Supported shells:
- bash
- zsh
- fish
- PowerShell

**Linux example:**
```bash
# Install bash completion (Linux)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install bash-completion

# Enable bash completion for this session
source /etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh

# Generate completion script
killahtask completion bash > ~/.killahtask_completion

# Load completion immediately
source ~/.killahtask_completion

# (Optional) Load automatically in every new terminal
echo "source ~/.killahtask_completion" >> ~/.bashrc

# Example usage:
# Type "killahtask c" then press TAB to complete to "complete"
```
